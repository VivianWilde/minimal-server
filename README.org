To create the image run ~docker build --tag vi-fileserver~ from within this directory.

To run the image, run ~docker run --mount src=$HOME,target=/host,type=bind vi-fileserver~.

Alternatively, simply run the ~run.sh~ script included within here to do both the build + run automatically.
It may take a while to download the Python image from dockerhub if you haven't already.

It should print out something like ~Running on http://172.17.0.3:5000~. Go to ~http://172.17.0.3:5000/get/<filepath>~ and it should return the text of that file (as long as the path exists on your filesystem).
For instance http://172.17.0.3:5000/get/hello.txt to access  =~/hello.txt=

In principle it should also work out-of-the-box with Podman, I just haven't tested that yet because Podman doesn't like my laptop.
